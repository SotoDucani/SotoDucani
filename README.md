### Hello There!

I'm Josh Herrmann, a New Englander now living in Western New York. I've worked as a Systems Administrator doing level 1 and 2 support, as a Systems Engineer running Microsoft on-prem and cloud systems, and now as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer supporting Windows, Linux, and Kubernetes based applications.

Most of my focus is on helping to establish solid DevOps and SRE practices across multiple customer Development and Engineering teams, maintaining infrastructure and pipelines for those teams, and collaborating with other SRE Teams across the company.
